## 📊 High-Level System Overview (For Presentations)

### The Problem
Radiology departments face complex daily staffing challenges:
- **Multiple modalities** require specialized coverage (CT, MR, X-ray)
- **Variable skills** within teams (emergency, cardiac, MSK specialists)
- **Changing schedules** with rotations, meetings, and boards
- **Fair workload distribution** across overlapping shifts
- **Real-time coordination** needed to match workers to incoming studies

Traditional manual assignment leads to:
- ❌ Overloading of experienced staff
- ❌ Inefficient use of specialist skills
- ❌ No visibility into cross-modality workload
- ❌ Time-consuming schedule preparation

### The Solution: RadIMO SBZ

RadIMO is an **intelligent workload orchestration system** that automates fair worker assignment while respecting expertise, availability, and rotation schedules.

**Core Workflow:**
```
Medical Scheduling System (medweb)
        ↓
Export monthly CSV with all worker activities
        ↓
RadIMO Import (one-time upload + daily auto-refresh at 7:30 AM)
        ↓
Intelligent Parsing:
  • Activity → Modality mapping (e.g., "CT Spätdienst" → CT evening shift)
  • Automatic skill assignment based on activity patterns
  • Time exclusions for boards/meetings (auto-splits shifts)
  • Worker-specific skill overrides for specialists
        ↓
Real-Time Assignment Engine (web interface)
  • Coordinator requests: "Need CT cardiac specialist"
  • System selects least-loaded qualified worker
  • Updates counters, tracks fairness metrics
  • Supports cross-modality overflow automatically
        ↓
Result: Fair distribution, specialist utilization, real-time visibility
```

### Key Innovation: Config-Driven Intelligence

**Before RadIMO:**
- Manual Excel file creation per modality
- Static schedules with no real-time adaptation
- No automatic fairness balancing
- Separate tools for tracking and assignment

**With RadIMO v18:**
- **Single CSV source** from existing medweb system
- **Configuration-based mapping** (add new activities without coding)
- **Automatic daily updates** (7:30 AM refresh)
- **Real-time fairness engine** (work-hour-adjusted balancing)
- **Intelligent fallback** (finds qualified alternatives automatically)
- **Admin portal for skill management** (update worker qualifications in seconds)

### Concrete Example

**Scenario:** It's 2 PM on Tuesday. CT is swamped, needs cardiac specialist.

**RadIMO's Decision Process:**
1. **Request:** Coordinator clicks "CT → Herz (Cardiac)" button
2. **Check availability:**
   - Dr. Müller: On shift, Herz=1 (active), ratio=2.1 (10 cases / 4.7 hours worked)
   - Dr. Schmidt: On shift, Herz=1 (active), ratio=1.8 (9 cases / 5.0 hours worked)
   - Dr. Weber: On shift, Herz=0 (fallback only), ratio=1.5
3. **Apply rules:**
   - Dr. Weber excluded (Herz=0 means passive, only for overflow)
   - Dr. Schmidt has lower ratio → selected (less loaded per hour worked)
4. **Fallback if needed:**
   - If both at max capacity → try Herz in MR/X-ray
   - If no Herz available → fallback to Notfall → Normal
5. **Update & track:**
   - Dr. Schmidt counter +1
   - Global stats updated
   - Fairness metrics recalculated

**Result:** Dr. Schmidt assigned, fair distribution maintained automatically.

### Time Exclusion Innovation

**Problem:** Workers need time for boards, meetings, teaching during their shift
- Traditional: Create multiple schedule entries (before/after meeting)
- RadIMO: Automatic shift splitting based on weekday schedules

**Example:**
```yaml
# Config: Tuesday board 15:00-17:00 with 30min prep
medweb_mapping:
  rules:
    - match: "Kopf-Hals-Board"
      exclusion: true
      schedule:
        Dienstag: "15:00-17:00"  # Tuesday only
      prep_time:
        before: "30m"             # Prep starts 14:30

# CSV: Dr. Müller has "Kopf-Hals-Board" + regular CT shift (07:00-21:00)

# RadIMO automatically creates:
Shift 1: 07:00-14:30  (available for assignments)
EXCLUDED: 14:30-17:00  (board + prep time)
Shift 2: 17:00-21:00  (available for assignments)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Day-specific rules (same board, different times per weekday)
- ✅ No manual CSV editing needed
- ✅ Prep time automatically added
- ✅ Multiple exclusions per worker supported

### Three-Page Admin System

RadIMO provides three distinct admin interfaces for different operational needs:

#### 1. 📋 **Skill Roster** (`/skill_roster`) - Planning Mode

**Purpose:** Plan worker skill changes for rotations and long-term scheduling
- Changes are **STAGED** - no immediate effect on current assignments
- Edit values: -1 (excluded), 0 (fallback), 1 (active)
- Click "Save to Staging" → saves to `worker_skill_overrides_staged.json`
- Click "Activate Changes" → applies staged changes to active roster
- Perfect for: Weekly rotation planning, training certifications, scheduled changes

**Use Case:**
1. Go to `/skill_roster` (admin password protected)
2. Find worker "AAn" in table
3. Change MSK from 0 → 1 (MSK rotation starts next week)
4. Click "Save to Staging" - **no immediate effect**
5. When ready: Click "Activate Changes" - **now applied to assignments**

#### 2. 📝 **Prep Next Day** (`/prep-next-day`) - Tomorrow's Schedule

**Purpose:** Prepare and preview tomorrow's worker schedule
- Upload new medweb CSV for next day
- Simple mode: Upload CSV, let system auto-parse
- Advanced mode: Edit individual workers, adjust times, modify skills
- Changes affect **tomorrow's date only** - no impact on today
- Perfect for: Daily schedule preparation, next-day corrections

#### 3. ⚠️ **Live Edit** (`/admin/live-edit`) - Emergency Same-Day Changes

**Purpose:** Make immediate changes to current day's assignments
- Changes take effect **IMMEDIATELY** - no staging
- Edit worker hours, names, skills, modifiers
- Delete worker entries
- Modality tabs (CT/MR/XRAY) for organized editing
- Big warning banners about immediate impact
- Perfect for: Emergency substitutions, last-minute schedule changes, same-day corrections

**⚠️ WARNING:** Use Live Edit with caution - changes are instant!

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Config-Driven Medweb CSV Integration** ⭐ NEW

Directly ingest medweb CSV schedules with configuration-based activity mapping:

```yaml
medweb_mapping:
  rules:
    # Single modality (traditional)
    - match: "CT Spätdienst"
      modality: "ct"
      shift: "Spaetdienst"
      base_skills: {Normal: 1, Notfall: 1, Privat: 0, Herz: 0, Msk: 0, Chest: 0}

    - match: "MR Assistent 1. Monat"
      modality: "mr"
      shift: "Fruehdienst"
      base_skills: {Normal: 1, Notfall: 0, Privat: 0, Herz: 0, Msk: 0, Chest: 0}

    # Multi-modality (sub-specialty teams) - NEW
    - match: "MSK Assistent"
      modalities: ["xray", "ct", "mr"]  # Available in all three modalities
      shift: "Fruehdienst"
      base_skills: {Normal: 0, Notfall: 0, Msk: 1, Privat: 0, Herz: 0, Chest: 0}
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual Excel file creation needed
- Activity → modality/skill mapping in config.yaml
- **Multi-modality support:** Sub-specialty teams across multiple modalities
- Extensible: add new activities by updating config
- Single CSV upload populates all modalities

### 2. **Automatic Daily Preload** ⏰ NEW

System automatically preloads the next workday schedule at **7:30 AM CET**:

- **Auto-preload**: Runs daily via APScheduler
- **Next workday logic**: Friday → Monday, other days → tomorrow
- **Master CSV**: Last uploaded CSV becomes source for auto-preload
- **Seamless workflow**: No manual intervention required

### 3. **Next-Day Schedule Preparation** 📝 NEW

Advanced edit interface for preparing tomorrow's schedule:

**Two Modes:**
- **Simple Mode**: Click any cell to edit inline (spreadsheet-like UX)
- **Advanced Mode**: Add/delete workers, bulk skill operations

**Features:**
- Modality tabs (CT/MR/XRAY) for easy navigation
- Color-coded skill values: 🟢 Active (1), 🟡 Passive (0), 🔴 Excluded (-1)
- Real-time change tracking with batch save
- Auto-recalculate shift durations when times change
- Completely separate from same-day editing (preserves assignment stability)

### 4. **Worker Skill Roster System** 👥 NEW

Per-worker skill overrides with modality-specific configuration:

```yaml
worker_skill_roster:
  AA:  # Any Arzt
    default:
      Msk: 1      # MSK specialist

  AN:  # Any NewArzt
    default:
      Chest: 1    # Chest specialist
    ct:
      Notfall: 0  # Only fallback for CT Notfall
```

**Configuration Precedence**: `worker_skill_roster` > `medweb_mapping` > worker mapping

### 5. **Dual View Modes**

Choose your workflow:

- **By Modality** (default): Navigate by modality (CT/MR/XRAY) → assign by skill
- **By Skill**: Navigate by skill (Normal/Notfall/Herz) → assign by modality

Toggle between views with one click!

### 6. **Smart Load Balancing**

- **Work-hour-adjusted ratios**: Balances workload based on hours worked, not just assignment count
- **Overlapping shift support**: Handles early/late starters fairly
- **30% imbalance threshold**: Automatic fallback when workload becomes unfair
- **Minimum assignments (Two-Phase)**:
  - **Phase 1 (No-Overflow)**: Until all ACTIVE workers (skill >= 1) reach minimum weighted assignments, restrict pool to underutilized workers
  - **Phase 2 (Normal Mode)**: Once everyone has minimum, allow normal weighted overflow
  - Only counts active workers (skill >= 1), not passive (0) or excluded (-1)
  - Uses WEIGHTED assignments (task weight 1.5 = 1.5 toward minimum, not "1")
  - Recommended: 2-3 weighted assignments

### 7. **Flexible Fallback Strategies**

Three modes to handle overflow:

| Strategy | Best For | Behavior |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **skill_priority** | Modality expertise | Try all skills in CT before moving to MR |
| **modality_priority** | Skill expertise | Try Herz in all modalities before trying Notfall |
| **pool_priority** | Maximum fairness | Evaluate all options globally, pick least loaded |

Configure in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
balancer:
  fallback_strategy: skill_priority  # or modality_priority, pool_priority
  imbalance_threshold_pct: 30
  min_assignments_per_skill: 5
```

### 8. **Skill Value System**

Fine-tune worker availability:

| Value | Name | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **1** | Active | Available for primary requests + fallback |
| **0** | Passive | Available ONLY in fallback (training, backup) |
| **-1** | Excluded | NOT available (on leave, restricted) |

## 📊 How It Works

### Medweb CSV to Assignment Flow

```
medweb.csv (monthly schedule from medweb)
    ↓
Upload via /upload (manual) or auto-preload at 7:30 AM
    ↓
Config-driven parsing (medweb_mapping rules)
    ↓
Apply worker_skill_roster overrides
    ↓
Build working_hours_df per modality (CT/MR/XRAY)
    ↓
Optional: Edit via /prep-next-day
    ↓
Real-time assignment system (balancer)
    ↓
Request: CT/Herz → Assign worker with lowest ratio
```

### Assignment Flow

```
Request: CT/Herz
    ↓
1. Check available workers (shift times, skill values)
2. Calculate workload ratio = weighted_assignments / hours_worked_so_far
3. Check imbalance (30% threshold)
    ↓
    If balanced: Select worker with lowest ratio
    If imbalanced: Try fallback (Herz → Notfall → Normal)
    ↓
4. Update counters (skill-specific, global, weighted)
5. Return assigned worker
```

### Workload Calculation

```python
# Dynamic ratio adjusted for shift progress
ratio = weighted_assignments / hours_worked_till_now

# Weighted assignments consider:
- Skill weight (Notfall=1.1, Privat=1.2, Normal=1.0, etc.)
- Modality factor (MR=1.2, CT=1.0, XRAY=0.33)
- Worker modifier (individual multipliers from config/CSV)

# Lower ratio = less loaded = selected
```

### Example: Overlapping Shifts

**At 10:00 AM:**
```
Worker A: 07:00-13:00, 10 assignments, 3h worked → ratio = 10/3 = 3.33
Worker B: 09:00-17:00,  7 assignments, 1h worked → ratio = 7/1 = 7.00

→ Worker A selected (lower ratio = less loaded per hour)
```

## 📋 Medweb CSV Format

RadIMO ingests monthly schedules from medweb in CSV format:

### Expected Columns

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Datum | Date in DD.MM.YYYY | 20.11.2025 |
| Tageszeit | Day period (ignored) | Tag |
| Personalnummer | Employee number | 12345 |
| Code des Mitarbeiters | Worker abbreviation | AM |
| Name des Mitarbeiters | Worker full name | Dr. Anna Müller |
| Beschreibung der Aktivität | Activity description | CT Spätdienst |

### Activity Mapping

Activities are mapped to modalities and skills via `config.yaml`:

| Activity | Modality/Modalities | Shift | Example Skills |
|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| CT Assistent | ct | Fruehdienst | Normal=1, Notfall=1 |
| CT Spätdienst | ct | Spaetdienst | Normal=1, Notfall=1 |
| MR Assistent | mr | Fruehdienst | Normal=1, Notfall=1 |
| MR Assistent 1. Monat | mr | Fruehdienst | Normal=1, Notfall=0 |
| Chir Assistent | xray | Fruehdienst | Normal=1, Notfall=1 |
| SBZ: MRT-OA | mr | Fruehdienst | Privat=1 (PP role) |
| **MSK Assistent** | **xray, ct, mr** ⭐ | Fruehdienst | **Msk=1** (sub-specialty team) |
| **Herz Team** | **ct, mr** ⭐ | Fruehdienst | **Herz=1, Notfall=1** |

⭐ **Multi-modality support (NEW):** Sub-specialty teams can be assigned across multiple modalities simultaneously.

Add new activity mappings by updating `medweb_mapping.rules` in `config.yaml`.

**Multi-modality syntax:**
```yaml
# Single modality (traditional)
- match: "CT Assistent"
  modality: "ct"
  base_skills: {Normal: 1, Notfall: 1}

# Multi-modality (sub-specialty teams)
- match: "MSK Assistent"
  modalities: ["xray", "ct", "mr"]  # Available in all three
  base_skills: {Msk: 1, Normal: 0}
```

## 🔐 Security

- **Admin password**: Configure in `config.yaml` (change default for production!)
- **Session-based auth**: Admin routes protected by login
- **No user registration**: Simple password-based access

---

## 🚦 Operational Checks

Run system health checks before deployment:

```bash
python ops_check.py
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ Config file validity
- ✅ Admin password configured
- ✅ Upload folder writable
- ✅ Modalities configured
- ✅ Skills configured
- ✅ Medweb mapping rules present
- ✅ Worker data loaded

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### Central Dispatcher Console
Run on modality workstations for real-time assignments by coordinators.

### Operations Analytics
Poll `/api/quick_reload` to feed dashboards showing overflow patterns.

### Cross-Site Coordination
Configure modality fallbacks to point to other campuses for remote coverage.

### Training & Backup Staff
Use passive skill values (0) for workers who can help but shouldn't be primary choice.

### Next-Day Planning
Use prep page to review and adjust tomorrow's schedule before auto-preload activates.

### Emergency Schedule Changes
Use force refresh when significant staffing changes occur mid-day (e.g., half the staff calls in sick).

## 🔧 Configuration Tips

### Adding a New Activity Type

1. Add rule to `config.yaml`:
```yaml
medweb_mapping:
  rules:
    - match: "Neue Aktivität"
      modality: "ct"
      shift: "Fruehdienst"
      base_skills: {Normal: 1, Notfall: 1, Privat: 0, Herz: 0, Msk: 0, Chest: 0}
```

2. Restart application (no code changes needed!)

### Configuring Worker-Specific Skills

1. Add to `worker_skill_roster` in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
worker_skill_roster:
  NEUID:  # Worker abbreviation
    default:  # Applies to all modalities
      Normal: 1
      Notfall: 1
      Herz: 1      # This worker does Herz
      Msk: -1      # Never for Msk
    mr:            # MR-specific overrides
      Herz: 0      # Only fallback for MR Herz
```

2. Restart application

### Adjusting Shift Times

1. Modify `shift_times` in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
shift_times:
  Fruehdienst:
    default: "07:30-15:30"  # Changed from 07:00-15:00
    friday: "07:30-13:30"
```

2. Restart application
